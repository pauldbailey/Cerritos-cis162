            <h2>Who Is Minnie?</h2>
            <p> Minnie is our brand new golden doodle puppy!  Despite the fact I'm crazy about animals (we are talking just about all of them.  I frequenly save spiders that would otherwse be doomed if my wife had any say in the matter) we have not had a pet since our bearded dragon crossed the rainbow bride during the pandemic.  That is no longer the case!.</p>
            <p> A few weeks ago my wife's cousin posted on her facebook about a puppy she needed to home.  We didn't think this was possible for us becuase she lives in Buffalo New York and golden doodles are way out of our price rainge.  After some chat we ended up paying to fly my wife's cousin and Minnie to California and for the last week we have been enjoying our new dog.</p>
            <p> It took a few days for Minnie to adjust to her new life in California, but she seems to have been born for the west coast!  She loves to play in our back yard and go on long walks.  She's already been to Venice Beach and our local park.  She even eats at dog friendly restaurants!</p>
            <p> Despite her young age she is already house trained, and will sit on command.  She is a tad stubron but overall easy to work with and just and fun and sweet as can be!</p>
