         Hello!  My name is Paul Bailey, a life long student currently enrolled at Cerritos College.  I have a BS in Business from Anderson University and a Masters of Special Education from the
         University of Phoenix.  In my recent past I was a mod/severe special education teacher and then the director of two different non-public schools.  It was a wonderful experience, but I wanted to find a
         way to use my nerd powers and work from home, so after a six month bootcamp I became a full stack .Net developer.  Bootcamp was horrible and didn't provide much depth in any of the topics, so I'm
         here slowly building my skills and filling in all the holes.
        </p>
