            <h2>Employment</h2>

            One of the very few benifits of being old(ish) is the change to experience, well...life!  I've had many different jobs through the years including:
            <ul>
                <li>Attraction Host (Disneyland)</li>
                 <li>Sales (inside and outside)</li>
                 <li>Management</li>
                 <li>Behavior Aide</li>
                 <li>Special Education Teacher (Mod/Severe/Transition) </li>
                 <li>Education Director </li>
                 <li>Fullstack Developer</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Education Goals</h2>

            Even though I currently serve as a full stack developer I recognize my training left much to be desired.  There are many skills I would like to learn or improve:
            <ul>
                <li>Front End Design</li>
                <li>Database Development(inside and outside)</li>
                <li>API Management and Devlopment</li>
            </ul>

                I want to use my background in special education and my experience working with Microsoft Access to develop robust systems that work through the internet to service the needs of schools that specialize in students with special needs.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Woodworking for 12 years</li>
                <li>Handywork (except plumbing.  I HATE plumbing)</li>
                <li>Music, Drums, Piano, and Singing (if enough drinks have been consumed)</li>
                <li>Split Local Database Development (Microsoft Access)</li>
                <li>Costume Prop Building (my wife sews the costumes, I build the stilly stuff)</li>
            </ul>
